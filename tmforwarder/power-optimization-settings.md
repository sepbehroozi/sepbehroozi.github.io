# Switching off Power Optimization Settings for TM Forwarder
When you install TM Forwarder on your phone, Android switches on some power optimization settings for the app by default. These settings might impact the TM Forwarder app functionality as the app needs to be active on the background and the Android OS does not like that!

To switch off the Android Power Optimization Settings for the `TM Forwarder` app, open the Power Optimization Settings on you phone, open the <img alt="TM Forwarder App Icon" src="./resources/tm-forwarder-icon.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> TM Forwarder app, Click on the upper left burger menu icon to open the application side menu, click on the <img alt="Settings Icon" src="./resources/settings_black_24dp.svg" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> Settings menu item, choose <img alt="Battery Icon" src="./resources/battery_saver_black_24dp.svg" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> `Power Saving Information` settings, and click on the `Open Battery Optimization Settings` button. It will take you to the Android's `Battery Optimization Settings` like below (It might look slightly different depending on your phone's OS version):

**Note:** Make sure you have selected `All apps` from the top drop-down menu <img alt="All apps Drop Down" src="./resources/all-apps-dropdown.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" width=100>
